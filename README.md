Let's Practice Using Pandas
---------------------------

Hotel X wants to know how customers feel about their stay at the hotel

Instructions:
-------------
Use the comments in the hotel reviews file (attached json file) to do a simple sentiment analysis


Install the sentiment analysis package afinn. You can find out more about it at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/afinn/0.1

Create a DataFrame that includes in its rows some data from each review.

Each row should include:

    •	review author's screen name
    •	author location
    •	review ID
    •	review date
    •	review title
    •	each rating provided by the reviewer
    •	an afinn sentiment score for the reviewer's written comment.

Save the dataframe to a shelve database.

Calculate descriptive statistics for the sentiment score to summarize the reviewers' feelings about their experiences with this hotel.

Extra Points:
------------
If you were providing these results to the hotel, and they asked you what their sentiment scores should be compared to.
what would you tell them?
